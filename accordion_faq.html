            <button class="accordion first-accordion">Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe
                    the
                    claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
                    website.
                    Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who
                    do
                    not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
                    individual
                    parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
                    organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras
                    day
                    (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                    Tuesday
                    is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                    Wednesday.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will
                    change
                    from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
                    chilly
                    morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                    Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                    somewhat
                    dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely
                    want
                    to bring a raincoat!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"> Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by? pack?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a
                    balcony, food and a bathroom pass.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"> How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we
                    call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"> I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi
                Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the
                    weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets
                    of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can
                    stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience
                    Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras
                    festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
                    costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">What happens if there is bad weather?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be
                    severe. The local TV and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour by hour updates.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion last-accordion">Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel last-accordion">
                <p>By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who
                    grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every
                    parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large
                    garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals,
                    beads and more.

                    The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                    anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon, since
                    parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles
                    is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having
                    picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about
                    the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                    You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like Metairie,
                    which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi
                    Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!
