                    LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                    Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman to
                    hold
                    the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council

            <h2>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h2>
            <article class="mardiGrasP">
                <p>
                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations
                    are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                    (the
                    start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day
                    (weather
                    permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place
                    the
                    last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans
                    and
                    surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).</p>
                <p>
                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade
                    schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                    earliest,
                    Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for
                    holding
                    large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities
                    as
                    grand
                    marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their
                    Kings),
                    as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
                    traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic
                    beads,
                    doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can
                    also
                    include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and
                    Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St.
                    Charles
                    Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                    concludes
                    with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
                <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                    River in
                    what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                    men
                    celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of
                    the
                    festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music
                    and
                    dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An
                    account
                    from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
                    masks in
                    the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
                    renewed
                    whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
                    Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
                    celebration.</p>
